## âœ… Task 1: Reviewing Technical Requirements

**Objective:**  
Evaluate and identify vague or incomplete non-functional requirements in a draft provided by Digital Health, a client of Accenture Nordics.

**What I Did:**  
- Reviewed a list of non-functional technical requirements including scalability, performance, recoverability, security, maintainability, operability, and availability.
- Identified that all listed requirements lacked **clarity**, **measurability**, and **realistic targets**.
- Suggested how each requirement could be rewritten to be clear, testable, and practically achievable.

**Key Insights:**
- Non-functional requirements must be **specific and measurable** to be useful for developers and testers.
- Vague requirements (like "The system should be fast") can lead to misunderstandings and project risks.
- Good documentation improves collaboration between UX, engineering, and quality assurance teams.
